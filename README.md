I'm Kerry, Front-End Web Developer. 
Graduated from Bath Spa University's first Skills Bootcamp in Web Development in October 2021 cohort.

I am ready to get stuck into working as a Web Developer. Looking for a company where I can grow and contribute, where code quality and cutting edge technologies are important.
